Most people pick plants based on taste or aesthetics. I wanted more.

Using ChatGPT, I built a decision table to weigh factors like:
- 🌱 Hardiness
- 🧬 Self-fertility
- ⚙️ Maintenance effort
- 🫐 Fruit yield
- ⚠️ Invasiveness risk

I then assigned weights and scores to each factor and ranked 10+ plant options for my area (Chesterfield, UK).  
The result? A structured, replicable way to choose *any* high-value plant for limited vertical space.

> ROI tables aren't just for finance. They're a fast way to bring trade-off thinking to daily life — from devops infrastructure to backyard design.

This post is part of a series on using AI + structured decision tools to make better choices with less regret.


{{< callout tip "Insight" >}}
Self-fertile plants improve yield even with suboptimal pollination, making them ideal for small UK gardens.

{{< callout note "Note" >}}
This ROI assumes average sun exposure in Chesterfield. Heavily shaded areas will reduce output.

{{< callout warning "Warning" >}}
Avoid invasive species like Japanese Knotweed — high yield isn’t worth the containment effort.
